# CSharp
Here are the simple projects I have completed while training to learn C# language by myself in 2017. 
The projects are from the educational C# tutorial videos by Murat Yücedağ. Please check his youtube page (https://www.youtube.com/user/YazilimHerYerde) for a detailed explanation about how to code in C#. 
The videos are in Turkish as well as most of the interface of the projects however the codes are easy to understand.
